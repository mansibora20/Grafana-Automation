## Overview

This project automates the deployment of Prometheus and Grafana using Ansible, providing a comprehensive system monitoring solution. It includes predefined dashboards for visualizing system metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Ansible playbook, ensure you have the following:

1. Ansible installed on your local machine.
2. Access to the target servers for deployment.
3. SSH access to the target servers with appropriate permissions.
4. Git installed on your local machine (for version control, optional).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/veerendra-pulapa/ansible-monitoring.git
 cd ansible-monitoring
1. Update the inventory file (inventory.yml) with the IP addresses and SSH credentials of your target servers.
2. Run the Ansible playbook:
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml monitoring_setup.yml

The playbook will install and configure Prometheus and Grafana on your target servers.

## Configuration
Ansible Playbook (monitoring_setup.yml):
 The playbook includes tasks to install and configure Prometheus and Grafana.
 Customize tasks based on your specific requirements.
Prometheus Configuration (prometheus.yml):
 Define scraping targets and additional configurations.
 Tailor this file to monitor specific metrics based on your needs.
Grafana Dashboard (dashboard.json):
 Customize the dashboard to visualize metrics relevant to your environment.
 Import the modified dashboard in the Grafana UI.

## Accessing Grafana
After running the playbook, access Grafana using the following steps:

1. Open a web browser and go to http://your_grafana_ip:3000.
2. Log in with the default credentials (admin/admin).
3. Configure Grafana to use Prometheus as a data source (default settings in prometheus.yml).
4. Import the provided Grafana dashboard JSON file (dashboard.json) for system monitoring.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the Ansible playbook, Prometheus configuration, and Grafana dashboard based on your specific monitoring requirements.

## Version Control (Optional)
If you want to track changes and collaborate:

1. Initialize a Git repository:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Monitoring setup with Ansible"
2. Push to your remote repository (e.g., GitHub):
git remote add origin https://github.com/veerendra-pulapa/ansible-monitoring.git
git push -u origin master
